  <h3>What exactly is Crypto</h3>
  <p>Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks
     to verify transactions. Itâ€™s a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone
      anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being physical money 
      carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments 
      exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific 
      transactions. When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are 
      recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.

    Cryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify 
    transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in storing and 
    transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and to public ledgers. 
    The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety.
    
    The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was founded in 2009 and 
    remains the best known today. Much of the interest in cryptocurrencies 
    is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward.</p>
